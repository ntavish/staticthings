# Prototyping

General workflow for most hardware projects starts with a prototype.

## Overview of how things are usually done

- Component selection

	- based on constraints like price, availability with vendors, supporting components, size, power requirement, heat, input voltage etc.

	- familiarity, ease of use, support, toolchains or other supporting software

	- availability of documentation/schematics from manufacturer or other people

---

- Prototype on breadboard or prfboard or stripboard (not always possible)
	
	- Not all components are available as DIP, sometimes there are too many lines

	- Breadboards/connecting wires dont have good electromagnetic characteristics, sometimes cannot use with high speed parts

- PCB prototype

	- Printed cicuit board is conducting metal laminated over a non-conducting substrate

	- First step for making this is a correct schematic

After schematic comes layout

- PCBs can be single layer, dual, multiple  layers.

- Single can sometimes be made at home

- PCBs serve a few puposes, like providing conducting paths,
  heat sink, mechanical support

- Green gots here connect the two layers on this pcb, they are called vias


#

- Placement is important, like crystals close to uC, decoupling capacitors too

- Mounting holes, connector placement

- Path lengths and presense of other tracks nearby change resistance of tracks, also capacitance and inductance

- differential signals and high speed parallel signals like USB or connections from RAM need length and impedance matching

- RF design
